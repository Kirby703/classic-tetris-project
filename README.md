# The Classic Tetris Bot

This repository is a new and improved bot for Classic Tetris Monthly that is designed to be accessible to the whole community, both in and out of CTM contexts. **This bot is not yet production ready and has not been rolled out.** It is designed, however, to be run on a cloud computing instance rather than a home PC, and as such its uptime will be drastically improved from the strikingly mediocre [current bot](https://github.com/professor-l/lsq-bot).

Here are some of the greater features the bot **supports** or _will support_:

* **Discord and twitch integration**
* **Account linking functionality**
* **Personal best tracking**
* _Other personal information storage (preferred name, country, etc.)_
* _A match queueing interface_
* _More to come!_

We are also very open to community input, since that's of course the best way to improve a project like this. So feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/professor-l/classic-tetris-project/issues) here on GitHub with any suggestions or bug reports. If you're familiar with Python and Django and you want to contribute, you're also free to [submit pull requests](https://github.com/professor-l/classic-tetris-project/pulls) at any point, and if you're looking to join the team, contact Professor L on Discord.

**NOTE:** This README is still in progress. Before rollout, it will include a comprehensive list of available commands and installation instructions. Additionally, we intend to write up a detailed description of our bot's architecture as well as our thought process behind it. We wrote this bot with scalability in mind, and it will be an ongoing project for months to come. 

A HUGE thanks to @dexfore (here's [his GitHub](https://github.com/michaelelin)) for his massive contributions to this new bot. It's no longer my baby, but ours.
